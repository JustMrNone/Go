A slice is like an array, except that its size changes dynamically as you add and remove items. The slice is one of Go's most useful types.

_ is called a blank indentifier

In Go's fmt package, the functions Print, Println, and Printf are used for formatted output, but they differ in how they handle formatting and output:

Print:

Outputs the arguments as they are, without adding any formatting or newlines.
Arguments are concatenated directly.
Example:
Println:

Outputs the arguments with a space between them and appends a newline at the end.
Useful for printing multiple values with automatic spacing and a newline.
Example:
Printf:

Outputs the arguments according to a specified format string.
Requires a format specifier (e.g., %v, %d, %s) to define how the arguments should be formatted.
Does not automatically add a newline.
Example:
Summary:
Use Print for simple concatenation.
Use Println for automatic spacing and newline.
Use Printf for formatted output with specific formatting requirements.
