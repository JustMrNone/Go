// Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Go is different from traditional OOP languages like Java or C++. Go doesnâ€™t have classes, inheritance,
// or traditional objects, but it supports key OOP principles through structs, methods, interfaces, and composition.
// (book Book): This part before the function name (print_details) is a method receiver in Go.
// book is the receiver variable, meaning that within this method, book represents an instance of the Book struct.
// Book is the type associated with the method. This means print_details() is a method that belongs to the Book struct.
